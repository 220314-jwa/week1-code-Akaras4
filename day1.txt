int score = 80;
// integer given title of "score" and given value of 80

String result;
//listing a set of conditions for the output
if (score == 80) {
	result = "You passed!";
//if the value is equal to 80, then the result will be "You passed!"
} else if (score > 80) {
	result = "You did great!";
//if the integer value is greater than 80, the result will be "You did great!"
} else {
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!";
//if neither the first nor second parameters are met, the result will be "You did not pass. Try again!"
}

System.out.println(result);
//the screen will have the true result typed out on screen

//the main goal of this program is to trigger a printed out response based on the value of the score. Three outcomes are possible: getting a passing score, getting a very good score, or not passing. In this instance, the integer is 80, and therefore results in the printed response "You Passed!"
